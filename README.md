# ATM SIMULATOR

nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does **not** require _any_ additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`. To use `nodemon`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/nodemon)

# Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshadjoshi01/AtmSimulator.git
cd AtmSimulator
npm i
```

Running nodemon sever

```bash
nodemon start
```

With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.

Now the application will run in localhost 3000 port by default.
If it's port 3000 then go to your browser => "localhost:3000"

## Application isn't restarting

In some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.

Via the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:

```bash
nodemon -L
```

Though this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.

## Delaying restarting

In some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.

To add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:

```bash
nodemon --delay 10 server.js
```

For more precision, milliseconds can be specified. Either as a float:

```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5 server.js
```

Or using the time specifier (ms):

```bash
nodemon --delay 2500ms server.js
```

The delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the _last_ file change.

If you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:

```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5

{
  "delay": 2500
}
```

## Design principles

- Fewer flags is better
- Works across all platforms
- Fewer features
- Let individuals build on top of nodemon
- Offer all CLI functionality as an API
- Contributions must have and pass tests

Nodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.
